Juicy, fruity, toffee aroma. Scents of apricot, watermelon, and melon-flavored gum. Way too fruity in aroma for my preferences. Milky, cardboard, plastic, off flavor. Drier than the aroma implies. Theres an astringency that is unpleasant. Awful at first but settles in to being merely very bad. Definitely flawed. Medium body. Reasonably lively. Forgettable palate effects. One of the worst bottled or canned beers Ive ever had. Id take a typical, boring, flavor-free, macro American pale lager over this any day')
